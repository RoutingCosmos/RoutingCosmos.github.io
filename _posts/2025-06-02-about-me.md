Hi! My name is Ryan. Most of my time in the working world has been spent in kitchens. Cooking is one of my lifelong passions. 
Working in various restaurants and hotels was always difficult in one way or another. The passion was always there but I couldn't
foresee myself having the future I wanted if I continued in these environments. That is when I began studying for IT certifications.
The first certification I ever received was the CompTIA Security+. Coming from a background of passion for technology, both parents
having worked in Law Enforcement, and taken courses in community college on Administration of Justice; I suppose the content was easier
for me to pick up from a conceptual point of view. With this newfound confidence in myself I began applying for IT Support positions. I
sent in resume after resume only to get rejected by the companies I wanted to work for. One day, however, a company saw potential in me
and ultimately offered me a position of IT Remote Support Specialist I in one of their offices. Those who have worked Help Desk have various
names they refer to their experience as and I won't talk about what they are here. Though I did learn a lot it seemed like every day on the job
was frustrating. I say that because I didn't always have the access needed to resolve issues on my own. More often than not end-users were
upset. In retrospect, if I had stayed in that role and found better ways to manage my stress I think I could have moved up in the company.
But then I would not be where I am today. 

Currently I am unemployed but working day and night learning Networking and Security. I purcashed a non-working computer on ebay and fully restored it.
I installed Ubuntu as the host OS and then Virtual Box with VMs for System Administration, Networking, and Cybersecurity projects. Where I currently live there
are not a lot of IT Support positions for Help Desk and Desktop Support, so I am working towards landing a new role either as a System Administrator, Network Administrator,
Network Engineer, AWS Support Engineer(Networking), Blue Team, Red Team, or DFIR. There's a lot of work that goes into training for these roles daily but I think going after
it now will give me the most opportunities for future success. I have a one month deadline to begin a new role, so the pressure is on. How does this lead me to become a Space
Network Engineer? When I recently began learning Networking, I built projects in my Home Lab and found myself wanting to know how far I could take Networking as a career. That
is when I learned about Space Networking. 

At present I am preparing for many career paths as I have previously stated, but they really come down to becoming strong at Networking and Security; both of which are essential
in space communication. The way I look at it is this. I am developing many skills now that will help me down the road to become an incredible Space Network Engineer. The path
to my ultimate role may not be traditional but very little in life typically is. For example, people who have transitioned to careers in Cybersecurity often come from backgrounds
you would never have guessed. So, my journey to space begins. In future posts I will write about how my journey is progressing, share projects I have completed, and more.
For now, I am signing off.
