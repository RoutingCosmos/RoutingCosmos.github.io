Welcome to the Labs directory!

This folder contains hands-on networking labs, configurations, scripts, and exercises designed to build practical skills.

## What you'll find here

Explore the files to learn and practice core and advanced networking concepts. Each lab is designed to be self-contained and includes notes on objectives and expected outcomes.
