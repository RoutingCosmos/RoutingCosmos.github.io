# VLAN Routing Lab

## Objective
Design and implement a multi-VLAN network using a Cisco 3560 multilayer switch to segment departmental traffic, enhance security, and enable inter-VLAN communication via Switched Virtual Interfaces (SVIs). 
This project demonstrates practical skills in VLAN configuration, Layer 3 switching, IP addressing, and network troubleshooting using Cisco IOS.
