# DHCP and DNS Configuration Lab

## Project Overview
This project simulates a local area network (LAN) environment using Cisco Packet Tracer to demonstrate DHCP and DNS services. 
The DHCP server is configured to dynamically assign IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS server information to client PCs. 
A local DNS server is set up with manually created A records to enable hostname-to-IP address resolution within the network.

## Network Components
- Router (Gateway)
- DHCP and DNS Server
- Client PCs (PC1, PC2)

## Key Features
- Dynamic IP address assignment using DHCP
- Manual DNS zone creation with A records for local hostname resolution
- Verification of network connectivity and DNS resolution using `ping` and `nslookup`
- Troubleshooting and resolution of DHCP scope and DNS record configuration issues

## Skills Developed
- DHCP and DNS server configuration and management
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Network troubleshooting using CLI tools
- Cisco Packet Tracer simulation and network design

## Notes
- All DHCP pools and DNS records were manually configured.
- This project serves as a foundation for understanding enterprise network services.
