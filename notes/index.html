    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Notes section of RoutingCosmos.</p>

    <p>This section serves as my personal reference area where I document key networking concepts, commands, and summaries from my ongoing studies and lab work.</p>

    <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Core networking concepts (TCP/IP, routing, switching, etc.)</li>
      <li>Cheat sheets and quick references</li>
      <li>Study summaries and certification prep notes</li>
      <li>Insights and important takeaways from hands-on work</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These notes are living documents that will grow and evolve alongside my journey to become a Space Network Engineer.</p>
